 1. Versioning
------------------

The versioning of schemas is a bit confusing and will be explained in this
text. Each schema file has its own version, major and minor. Client and
server must always adhere to the same version of particular schema in order
to avoid any misunderstanding and proper operation. The version of schemas
is announced in greeting from server.

Versions in ChangeLog enclosed in brackets are derived from versions of
mod_eppd, which is an apache module parsing EPP requests. For enduser are
these versions meaningless and serve only as identifiers of particular points
in time. If you use official epp client provided by CZ.NIC and want to know,
if your particular client of version x.y.z is compatible with server (mod_eppd)
of version a.b.c, check Compat chapter in this README.

 3. Edit notes
---------------

Here are few advices for editors of schemas. If you edit the schema file
make sure that you adhere to following rules:

 *) Indentation is 2 spaces long
 *) Always use spaces, not tabs.
 *) Try to define top level elements first and then the elements contained
    in them.
 *) First half of schema should be about input elements (elements generated
    on client's side) and the second about output elements (generated on
    server's side).
 *) After a change use xmllint to valide schemas.
